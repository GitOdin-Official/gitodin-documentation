<p>In fancy terms, we are a Hosted Realtime Communications API provider.<br>
<br>
What does that mean? Simply put, to be able to integrate realtime into your application you will require a relay. In most cases, managing such a server
can be quiet a headache and annoying; thus companies like Pusher are created. I've used companies like them for awhile. When I simply couldn't justify it anymore, I built my own network with intelligence for my projects. 
Our infastructure allows us to scale vertically and/or horizonally on the fly, thus ensuring no matter the load the performance will always be optimized. <br>
<br>In short, your client triggers a HTTPS requst to one of our Regional Towers which is known as a Ping Request. We process it and broadcast it to your listens which in turn allow for realtime updating.
GitOdin provides you a secure method of integrating realtime in your games, maps, software application and web applications with ease that scale when you scale.<br><br>
We believe in you and giving you a higher standard of free service than our competition.<br><br>Give it a try, it's free.<br>Because we believe in <b>you</b>.</p>
