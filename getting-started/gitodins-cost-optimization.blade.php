<p>GitOdin has been in development for over a year now since January 2017. Mostly because we set some pretty high standards be it getting our overhead cost down by optimizing our network or network response rates.
With this, we bring the savings to you and not in the pockets of investors such is the trend of our competition. Our network is architecture to basically have no limits.<br>

GitOdin has partnered up with <a href="https://servitor.io">Servitor</a> and <a href="https://ploi.io">Ploi</a> to scale and descale on demand, on the go with zero downtime.
This allows us to handle your burst and not maintain huge overhead cost keeping servers on standby. We are able to scale in seconds of noticing a burst.</p>
