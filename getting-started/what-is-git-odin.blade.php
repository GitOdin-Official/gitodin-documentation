<p>In fancy terms, we are a Hosted Realtime Communications API provider.<br>
<br>
What does that mean? Simply put, to be able to integrate real-time into your application you will require a relay. In most cases, managing such a server
can be quite a headache and annoying; thus companies like Pusher are created. I've used companies like them for a while. When I simply couldn't justify it anymore, I built my own network with intelligence for my projects.
Our infrastructure allows us to scale vertically and/or horizontally on the fly, thus ensuring no matter the load the performance will always be optimized. <br>
<br>In short, your client triggers an HTTPS request to one of our Regional Towers which is known as a Ping Request. We process it and broadcast it to your listeners which in turn allow for real-time updating.
GitOdin provides you a secure method of integrating real-time in your games, maps, software applications and web applications with ease that scales when you scale.<br><br>
Give it a try, it's free.<br>Because we believe in <b>you</b>.</p>
